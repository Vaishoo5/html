Common Language Runtime (CLR):
-------------------------------
Acts a memory manager (garbage collection),
Acts as a translator, understands all these languages and makes sure the code can communicate with each other.
Inspects the code and catch mistakes. 

Class libraries:
----------------
.NET Framework includes a vast set of class libraries that provide pre-built functionality for common tasks.
These libraries are organized into namespaces, developers can access and use their components.



Cross-Platform Development:
---------------------------
.NET 5 and later, are designed to be cross-platform. 
This means you can develop and run .NET applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Language Versatalty:
--------------------
.NET Framework supports multiple programming languages, including C#, VB.NET, F#, and more.
C# is versatile and can be used for desktop applications (Windows Forms, WPF), web development (ASP.NET), games (Unity)

Application Types:
------------------
1. Windows Forms: For building desktop applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).
2. WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): For creating rich desktop applications with advanced user interfaces.
3. Xamarin: For cross-platform mobile app development.
4. Console Applications: For command-line utilities.
5. Web APIs: For building RESTful APIs.
6. ASP.NET: For developing web applications and services.

Base Class Library:
-------------------
Base Class Libraries (BCL) are collections of reusable classes, types, and functions that provide fundamental functionality for building software applications in a particular programming environment or platform.
developers can use to perform essential tasks without having to reinvent the wheel. 
Namespaces like System, System.IO, and System.Net are part of the .NET BCL.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
----------------------------------------
provides all the tools and features needed to create, edit, test, and manage .NET-based software projects in one place. 


ASP.NET:
--------
ASP.NET allows you to write code that runs on the web server.
Active Server Pages .NET." ASP.NET takes care of handling web requests, processing data, and generating web pages on the server side.


Web Development in .NET: 
------------------------
It means you write code using languages like C# or Visual Basic .NET to build the logic and functionality of your website.
